# Engineering-Mechanics-2
ME 104 at UC Berkeley with Prof. Ken Karmin

Class Summary:
The purpose of ME 104 is to learn how to describe and predict the motion of objects and systems
of objects subject to various kinds of imposed forces and constraints. There is a joint emphasis on
theoretical development and problem solving.
